Told on Piazza that error checking only needed to be used for the errors explicitly asked to be checked for in the homework assignment (bucket filled, bucket exists), and as a result assumes that all input is properly formatted

to compile, simply use g++ -o problem4 problem4.cpp for problem 4's code or g++ -o problem5 problem5.cpp for problem 5's code

to run problem 4, type ./problem4 hw1q4.txt into the commandline

to run problem 5, type ./problem5 hw1q5.txt into the commandline
